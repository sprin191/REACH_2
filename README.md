# AAI_Code_Challenge

Challenge Description: Employees at August Ash (AAI) are good-natured. We love to watch and share funny or creative videos with each other. AAI would like an application that allows employees to maintain a list of curated video links, view top ten lists, and to submit and rate linked videos. 

User Scenarios:
1) As an employee, I would like to see all video links with the most recent first so that I can quickly view which excellent videos my teammates are posting. 
2) As an employee, I want to view a top ten list of videos ranked by number of views so that I can see what's most popular among my teammates. 
3) As an employee, I want to view a top ten list of videos ranked by number of votes so that I can see what's most liked by my teammates. 4) As an employee, I want to submit a new video link so that I can share my favorite Internet content with the company. 
5) As an employee, I should be able to vote-up or vote-down a video link once per day so I can contribute to the company's most highly-favored videos.
