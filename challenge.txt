Your company downloaded this application from a website to use for hour tracking.
Your co-worker started updating the code to use jade + stylus + nib but has been put on another project.
Please complete the following:

	1.) Install all the project pre-requisites
	2.) Fix the following user complaints:
		Every time the server is restarted, we lose all the data in the system
		My username and password is clearly visible in the address bar, what if someone walks by? worse yet, I can see it in the browser history!
		When I submit my hours, it takes a really long time, what gives?
		Sometimes when I am using the system at the same time as someone else, our hours get mixed up

	3.) modify the code to conform to best practices as you understand them
	4.) identify any security vulnerabilities and recommend a solution
	5.) this program is ugly! show us your front-end styling and javascript skills!
	6.) implement 2 or more of the following:
		- finish implementing all HTML in jade (or another templating engine if you prefer)
		- a user cannot work more than 40 hours in a week (*COMPLETE*)
		- a user cannot work more than 10 hours in a single day (*COMPLETE*)
		- if a user works Saturday and Sunday, they must not work Monday (*COMPLETE*)
		- write an administrative section which allows specific users to define which days an employee is allowed to work
